			<p class="Indent---L1"><span class="Basic-Style">That heredity is used as a basis is common. It is natural for a country to consider a child as its citizen wherever he is born, if the child’s parents are citizens of that country. </span></p>
			<p class="Indent---L1"><span class="Basic-Style">At the same time, the child’s parents do not always have the same citizenship, and not always the child has a legal family relationship with his parents.

			<p class="Indent---L1"><span class="Basic-Style">In terms of citizenship, this law </span><span class="Poem">assumes</span><span class="Basic-Style"> that there is always a legal family relationship between the child and the mother; The legal family relationship between the child and the father only exists if the child is born in or from a legal marriage or if the child is legally recognized by the father. </span></p>
			<p class="Indent---L1"><span class="Basic-Style">If there is a family law relationship between the child and the father, then the father determines the nationality of the child (see Article 1 paragraphs b and c), unless the father is unable to</span></p>

			<p class="Indent---L1"><span class="Basic-Style">Adoption of children is common in Indonesia. The legal adoption of a child is determined by the law of adopting a child. Sometimes the adopted child is </span><span class="Poem">a foreigner</span><span class="Basic-Style">, but because he is truly treated as his own child, the origin of that person is no longer known or felt. So, such a child should be given the status of the adoptive parent. </span></p>
			<p class="Indent---L1"><span class="Basic-Style">As a guarantee that the adoption is truly an adoption as described above and so that the foreign child who is adopted can really still feel like an Indonesian citizen, the granting of Indonesian citizenship to the adopted child should be limited to a very young child (see Article 2). </span></p>

The child should be given the opportunity to obtain the citizenship of the Republic of Indonesia, if he is considered to have been able to determine his own nationality. The granting of this opportunity should be limited to children outside of marriage, because in marriage, parents and children are principally a unit whose status is determined by the father. Meanwhile, because the person concerned has been a foreigner </span><span class="Poem">for so long</span><span class="Basic-Style">, the opportunity is in the form of a request. </span></p>

The extent to which and the manner in which us soli (right of soil or birthright citizenship) is carried out on people who are not stateless depends on the circumstances of each country. Because citizenship should not be enforced on people who already have other nationalities, entry into the Indonesian citizenship environment should come from the person’s own wishes. For reasons as above (no. 1), the opportunity given is in the form </span><span class="Poem">of</span><span class="Basic-Style"> a request. According to this law, the people who are given this opportunity are those who were born from a resident or who later became residents, who were also born in Indonesia. </span></p>

Of course, Indonesia’s interests should not be disturbed by the granting of citizenship. So that the granting of citizenship does not conflict with the purpose of the granting, then conditions are held, all of which are objective. </span></p>
			<p class="Indent---L1"><span class="Basic-Style">Because the granting of citizenship includes the discretion of the executive power, the one who grants citizenship is the Government, in this case the Minister of Justice with the approval of the Council of Ministers. </span></p>
			<p class="Indent---L1"><span class="Basic-Style">Of course, the Government in terms of granting citizenship is responsible to the Parliament, and must not deviate from the specified conditions. Regarding the matter of citizenship, furthermore, please read Article 5 which is clear enough. It is ordinary citizenship at the request of people who wish to become citizens of the Republic of Indonesia. </span></p>
			<p class="Indent---L1"><span class="Basic-Style">There is a possibility that for Indonesia’s own interests it is necessary to have a citizen, or a foreigner, because he has served the Republic of Indonesia as if he were a citizen. In this case, the conditions specified for the application for ordinary citizenship do not apply. </span></p>
