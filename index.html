        In 1965, a CIA-aided military coup marked the beginning of a tumultuous period in Indonesia. The new
        authoritarian government, perceiving a "Chinese Problem," initiated a series of anti-Chinese policies from
        1967-2000: Chinese language names barred on official documents, Chinese language media and schools shuttered,
        while public celebrations of cultural festivals such as Chinese New Year were banned.
    </p>
    <p>
        These exclusionist and forced assimilation laws, echoing the Indian Treaties & the Removal Act, the 1882 Chinese
        Exclusion Act, and the Immigration Act of 1924 in the United States, fostered resentment and discrimination that
        led to massacres and sexual violence against the Indonesian Chinese community in 1965 and 1998.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project by artist Paula Te and writer Edward Gunawan (who are both of Chinese Indonesian descent) takes the
        form of erasure poems based on actual laws from this dark chapter of history. Through different interactions,
        the art allows the reader to reveal the text behind the redaction, inviting us to investigate the invisible
        historical forces that impact present-day culture, society, politicsâ€“and ultimately, our sense of personal
        flourishing and communal belonging.
